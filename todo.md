# To Do

* Create Mad Libs selection page
* Write the mad libs story with blanks
* ~~figure out how to use js to insert user inputs into a mad lib~~
* Also choose fonts for the website
* finish homepage
* maybe figure out how to allow users to create custom links to share their mad lib results? (it might take me years to do it ngl)
* Create website for each mad lib
* probably branch from the main every time I have a problem that might take me 2 hours like the fetching input issue (we have branches for a reason :p)
* write wayyy better mad lib templates (look for inspo online, or base it off one of my existing stories)
* consider using different javascript scripts for the different mad libs (1 script per madlib form and result page). I'm doing the portfolio script thing again because I feel like it would be easier for me to do it this way
* add a basic nav (not a fancy sidebar, i'm not dealing with that again)
