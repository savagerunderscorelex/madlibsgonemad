# Notes n stuff

## To-Do

* ~~Create Mad Libs selection page~~
* ~~Write the mad libs story with blanks~~
* ~~figure out how to use js to insert user inputs into a mad lib~~
* Also choose fonts for the website
* finish homepage
* maybe figure out how to allow users to create custom links to share their mad lib results? (it might take me years to do it ngl)
* ~~Create ~~website~~ page for each mad lib~~
* probably branch from the main every time I have a problem that might take me 2 hours like the fetching input issue (we have branches for a reason :p)
*~~ write wayyy better mad lib templates (look for inspo online, or base it off one of my existing stories)~~
* ~~consider using different javascript scripts for the different mad libs (1 script per madlib form and result page). I'm doing the portfolio script thing again because I feel like it would be easier for me to do it this way~~
* ~~add a basic nav (not a fancy sidebar, i'm not dealing with that again)~~
* edit scrollbar
* HOW COULD I FORGET ABOUT FAVICONS????? I NEED TO MAKE FAVICONS
* standardize the input colors on mad lib form 1
* mention that these are surprise mad libs
* ~~switch around `<a>`s and `<button>`s to make the whole button an anchor (move class navlinks to anchor instead of button)~~
* ~~finish off mad lib results variables in javascript file~~
* style the mad lib paragraphs
* Create Color Theme (Scrollbar, backgrounds, color theme for each page)
* structure the homepage better
* add links to links page



## Basic Overview of Pages

* Mad Lib Selection (3 main parts)
* Homepage
* Mad Lib Form and Results (Nav, form, result, footer) x 3
* Sources/Links (if I'm too lazy and end up using mad libs that I find online)
