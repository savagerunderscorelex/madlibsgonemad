# To Do

* Create Mad Libs selection page
* Write the mad libs story with blanks
* ~~figure out how to use js to insert user inputs into a mad lib~~
* Also choose fonts for the website
* finish homepage
* maybe figure out how to allow users to create custom links to share their mad lib results? (it might take me years to do it ngl)
* Create website for each mad lib
* probably branch from the main every time I have a problem that might take me 2 hours like the fetching input issue (we have branches for a reason :p)
* write wayyy better mad lib templates (look for inspo online, or base it off one of my existing stories)
