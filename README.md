# Mad Libs Gone Mad

## Overview

Mad Libs Gone Mad is a website where you make mad libs through inputting nouns, verbs, and adjectives and receiving a jumbled story in return. This is just like a regular Mad Lib you would complete, but only that you don't know what your answers to the form will look like in the final Mad Lib paragraph!

## Journey

This is the quickest that I've ever completed a project, probably. I spent the last 2-3 weeks working mainly on this project. I even remember falling asleep during a field trip, and dreaming up a solution to one of the problems I had when coding the Javascript inputs because of how much I was working on it. I'm very proud of how this turned out, even though the CSS was extremely simple.

This project was also my first time using a framework (Bootstrap.js). Although I didn't use it all too much (I mainly used it to style buttons and center text), it made doing the CSS Portion wayyyyy easier.

Throughout this project, I struggled a lot with the Javascript side of things. Although the basis of the Javascript code that makes the mad lib possible was based on some code I created for a random online Zoom call I found on the internet, it somehow took hours to even get the code to work on this project. I have some type of bad luck when it comes to following tutorials or following an example, where I would do the exact thing but it would always never work on my end. However, I'm glad that I pulled through and managed to finally finish the project!

## Inspiration

This was inspired by the Mad Lib assignments I did during elementary school (especially when I was in third grade). Doing this project gave me a throwback to my younger years and reminded me of many memories from around that time. I think Mad Libs are super fun, so I found it cool that I could make my own!!
