Started Mad Libs Project. I'm also experimenting with bootstrap.js in this project as well. I started on the home page (index.html) and added the basic html for the introduction and the button to start the 1st Mad Lib.
I plan to create 2-3 Mad Libs for the user to make. 


Mad Lib 1:
the 1stnoun was verb(ing) down the (2ndnoun), wanting to find a/an (3rdnoun). The 1stnoun entered the store to find the (3rdnoun). The (1st-adjective) (1stnoun) went up to the (servicejobperson) and asked about the (3rdnoun). The (servicejobperson) told the (1stnoun) that the (3rdnoun) cost (number) dollars. [could use if/and statements ] The (1stnoun) looked inside their (color)(4noun) to check their money. 
The (1stnoun) found out they only had (number) dollars.

1. The (1stnoun) realizes that they don't have enough money to buy the (3rd noun). They leave the store, defeated.
2. The (1st noun) has enough money to buy the (3rdnoun). They purchase the (3rdnoun) from the (servicejobperson), elated.

I changed the gradiente of the first mad lib form, changed the color of the glow when "focused" (and I'm trying to change it so that it'll changed smoother)
I changed the color of the text, and I think that's pretty much it 

9:03 PM I changed the color of the shadow and border of the 1st mad lib form element inputs

5:54 AM I tried to code getting the input from users and storing them in a variable to put in the madlib. I tried to do this by first using code I created in a class and changing the values for this project,
but whenever I tried to test the code it wouldn't work at all. According to the developer tools console log, there aren't any values to log, and when I try the value method it doesn't automatically put the value method (which means the code I'm doing rn is not valid.)

Here is a solution I'm thinking of to check when I come back from school:

let noun1 = document.getElementbyId("id") (or query selector)

function (click, submit) OR form.onsubmit {
    1. turn the input into a value (.value)
    2. console log the value
}
6PM I'm gonna be sick. I spent 25 minutes working on trying to fix the issue of getting the input value from the form but it isn't working at all. One idea I had was that 
the bootstrap is interfering with everything, which makes the code not work. I'll try right now to adjust the code without the bootstrap cdns.
