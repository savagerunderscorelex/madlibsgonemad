Started Mad Libs Project. I'm also experimenting with bootstrap.js in this project as well. I started on the home page (index.html) and added the basic html for the introduction and the button to start the 1st Mad Lib.
I plan to create 2-3 Mad Libs for the user to make. 


Mad Lib 1:
the 1stnoun was verb(ing) down the (2ndnoun), wanting to find a/an (3rdnoun). The 1stnoun entered the store to find the (3rdnoun). The (1st-adjective) (1stnoun) went up to the (servicejobperson) and asked about the (3rdnoun). The (servicejobperson) told the (1stnoun) that the (3rdnoun) cost (number) dollars. [could use if/and statements ] The (1stnoun) looked inside their (color)(4noun) to check their money. 
The (1stnoun) found out they only had (number) dollars.

1. The (1stnoun) realizes that they don't have enough money to buy the (3rd noun). They leave the store, defeated.
2. The (1st noun) has enough money to buy the (3rdnoun). They purchase the (3rdnoun) from the (servicejobperson), elated.

I changed the gradiente of the first mad lib form, changed the color of the glow when "focused" (and I'm trying to change it so that it'll changed smoother)
I changed the color of the text, and I think that's pretty much it 

9:03 PM I changed the color of the shadow and border of the 1st mad lib form element inputs

5:54 AM I tried to code getting the input from users and storing them in a variable to put in the madlib. I tried to do this by first using code I created in a class and changing the values for this project,
but whenever I tried to test the code it wouldn't work at all. According to the developer tools console log, there aren't any values to log, and when I try the value method it doesn't automatically put the value method (which means the code I'm doing rn is not valid.)

Here is a solution I'm thinking of to check when I come back from school:

let noun1 = document.getElementbyId("id") (or query selector)

function (click, submit) OR form.onsubmit {
    1. turn the input into a value (.value)
    2. console log the value
}
6PM I'm gonna be sick. I spent 25 minutes working on trying to fix the issue of getting the input value from the form but it isn't working at all. One idea I had was that 
the bootstrap is interfering with everything, which makes the code not work. I'll try right now to adjust the code without the bootstrap cdns. 

6:16PM Don't know what the hell I did but it works now :) I tested the feature with the heading and it works now. I know there is a more "practical" and probably better way to do all this (basically actually learning backend) BUTTTTTTTTT that'll take kinda long, and 
I started this as a small project that I can work on in between my bigger project (the music website). so basically I don't want to take hours learning something rn for a smaller project (not saying that I don't want to learn backend, though).

7:32 PM I finished creating variables for the mad lib inputs in javascript. No this task did not take me an hour, I took a break.

7:38 PM I added the rest of the pages that I will likely need to finish the project. i've reached my goal of coding 2 hours, so I'll get going now :)

Around 6PM I moved around the files for my project. I changed the color of the background and centered the submit button. I also made the input fields turn a shade gray when clicked on. 

Currently, I've been trying to figure out how to output the mad lib form inputs onto the template. However, I realized that I ACTUALLY have to do some form of backend to do it, which I don't think I would have time to learn. So, I'm just going to put the form and the result on one page, to make everything easier. I wish I took programming seriously, like 5 years ago.

9/26 
9:46 AM What I planned to do instead was to put the the result on the same page as the form. I finally got it to work (I forgot to update the querySelector value). However, I'm not sure how to format the site for it to work on the same page. 

9:40 PM I think I'll just keep everything on the same page. I deleted the results page so that I could put the results and the form on the same page.
